# ðŸŒˆ Photon

Photon is a minimalist, real-time [path tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing), built from scratch using WebGPU compute shaders and [WGSL](https://w3.org/TR/WGSL).

- **Dependency-free:** The actual renderer uses no external dependencies; all rendering code and mathematical expressions have been implemented from scratch
- **Real-time:** This is a hardware accelerated path tracer, running computations in parallel on the GPU, which grants interactive frame rates for most operations

Photon takes a three-dimensional, geometric scene description and synthesizes an image by simulating the physically accurate propagation of light from the perspective of a virtual camera.
