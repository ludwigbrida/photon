# ðŸŒˆ Photon

Photon is a minimalist, dependency-free [path tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing), built from scratch using WebGPU compute shaders and [WGSL](https://w3.org/TR/WGSL).

It takes a three-dimensional, geometric scene description and synthesizes a two-dimensional image by simulating the physically accurate propagation of light within this scene from the perspective of a virtual camera.
